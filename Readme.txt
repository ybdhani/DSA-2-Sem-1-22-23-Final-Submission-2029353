Introduction

This code implements an iterated greedy algorithm for solving a machine job scheduling problem. The algorithm starts with a randomly generated solution and repeats the process of partially destructing the solution and reconstructing it until a stopping criterion is met. The code includes functions for initializing the solution, destructing the solution partially, reconstructing the machine selection, and reconstructing the sequence and machine selection.
Getting Started

The code requires Python 3.x to run. To use the code, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
    Run the following command:

    python iterated_greedy.py

Configuration

The code can be configured by changing the following variables in the main function:

    num_jobs: the number of jobs to be scheduled
    num_machines: the number of machines available for scheduling
    stopping_criterion: the maximum number of iterations the algorithm should run

Output

The code prints the initial solution and the final solution to the terminal. The solution is represented as a list of integers, where each integer represents the assigned machine for a job.
Conclusion

This code provides a basic implementation of an iterated greedy algorithm for solving a machine job scheduling problem. The code can be used as a starting point for further development and optimization.
